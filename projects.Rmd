#  ## `r fa("flask", fill = "steelblue")` [antisense RNA]

I was fortunate to have the oportunity to learn about data analysis and data science during my PhD. I was eager to learn about these to complement and supplement my primary research. I have experience working in Matlab, Python and especially in R. In the following, I illustrate a few examples of how I use programming to access data and vizualize it.



## `r fa("laptop-code", fill = "steelblue")` [Gene expression vizualization](https://athiemicke.com/Project0.html)

- This project uses data from [Ferreiro et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187982) in which the authors measured chenges in gene expression of MEF cells in hypertonic stress
- The datasets provides an insight into changes in gene expression in mammalian cells over time. 


<!-- ## `r fa("laptop-code", fill = "steelblue")` [Natural language processing approach to search for hidden information in the scientific literature](https://athiemicke.com/Project1.html) -->

<!-- - In this project I applied methods of natural language processing to the scientific literature -->
<!-- - I am a systems biologist and am interested in behavior of cells in certain conditions -->
<!-- - This means I am looking at biology in a different angle than most biologists do -->
<!-- - In this project I apply this angle and screen throught the fullltext of 1000s of articles that meet specific criteria to unveil hidden results and information -->



## `r fa("laptop-code", fill = "steelblue")` [Protein Network dynamics](https://athiemicke.com/Project2.html)

- A shiny app that will allow you to explore the dynamics of dozens of proteins in their response to hypertonic stress
- Explore single-cell distributions of flow cytometry data


<!-- ## `r fa("laptop-code", fill = "steelblue")`  [Machine learning applied to Health care datasets](https://athiemicke.com/Project3.html) -->

<!-- - A combined dataset of hospice, census and cancer data -->
<!-- - We applied machine learning algorhitms to uncover hidden trends and connections -->

## `r fa("laptop-code", fill = "steelblue")`  [Nutrition info](https://athiemicke.com/Project4.html)

- Vizualize contents of nutrients of different foods against each other
- See the amount of a nutrient per calorie
